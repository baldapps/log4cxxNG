## HowTo

Log4cxxNG use the same methods of Log4cxx so if you are already using Log4cxx
the porting is really easy. You need to be careful only to init and shutdown phases.
Here a basic example:

```cpp
#include "com/foo/bar.h"
using namespace com::foo;
    
// include log4cxxng header files.
#include "log4cxxNG/logger.h"
#include "log4cxxNG/logmanager.h"
#include "log4cxxNG/basicconfigurator.h"
#include "log4cxxNG/helpers/exception.h"
    
using namespace log4cxxng;
using namespace log4cxxng::helpers;
    
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    int result = EXIT_SUCCESS;
    try
    {
        //first method to call in your main
        LogManager::init();
        // Set up a simple configuration that logs on the console.
        BasicConfigurator::configure();

        LoggerPtr logger(Logger::getLogger("MyApp"));
        LOG4CXXNG_INFO(logger, "Entering application.")
        Bar bar;
        bar.doIt();
        LOG4CXXNG_INFO(logger, "Exiting application.")
    }
    catch(Exception&)
    {
        result = EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    
    //call before exit
    LogManager::shutdown();
    return result;
}
```
